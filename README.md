# OpenDrive_Drone_Dataset
This repository provides OpenDrive maps for the recordings in the InD, RounD and OpenDD datasets


## Description
[InD](https://levelxdata.com/ind-dataset/) and [RounD](https://levelxdata.com/round-dataset/) datasets do not provide maps. We created maps for these datasets by using RoadRunner based on the provided images and scaling factors. Although the [OpenDD](https://l3pilot.eu/data/) dataset provides a map, the map has some problems when importing to OpenDrive-supported software. We fixed these bugs and provide the new maps.
